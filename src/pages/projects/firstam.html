        </header-section-wc>

        <p>
            Reimagining the Sketch* product experience was <span class="bold">my first ever large-scale client project</span> and one that will always have a place in my heart. In 2018, I was the sole designer at the software agency I was working. I joined the project from the beginning and continued until it ended one year later. I've always liked exploring new ways of collaboration and diving deeper into brainstorming experiments, which was the main reason I was chosen to join the team, as my company was also open to experimentation at that time.
        </p>

        <p>
            ACI Sketch is a web and mobile application used by appraisers and property inspectors in the US, and it consists of two parts: the floor plan sketching and data collection. It allows property inspectors to look for properties, schedule appointments for inspection, collect data, outline accurate floor plans and manage the paperwork around the appraisal process.
        </p>

        <p>
            Even though Sketch had been distributed to its customers and employees for many years, there had been <span class="bold">significant shifts to competitive products over time.</span> Eventually, our clients approached my agency, intending to <span class="bold">rebrand and improve the user experience</span> of their product but also rewrite the codebase from scratch.
        </p>

        </header-section-wc>

        <p>
            It was important for me to <span class="bold">understand what exactly sparked our clients' decision</span> to reinvent the inspection experience entirely. Was their decision based on customer data or feedback? Was it because of shifts in business objectives? And if so, how could my team and I better serve that goal?
        </p>
        <p>
            I teamed up with the Product Manager and UI Developer, and we prepared a research plan together. Unfortunately, due to time and budget limitations, we had only three weeks to extract as much knowledge as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the beginning, <span class="bold">our team had no clue about how the appraisal business works</span> and what the property inspectors' workflow looks like, so we took the chance to organize <span class="bold">multiple interviews with various stakeholders</span>, along with chunks of desk research. At the end of each interview, I was relieved to clear up any confusion I previously had but, at the same time, I generated double the questions for the next one. As it seemed overwhelming when we started, we managed to structure a knowledge repository for our future reference after a couple of weeks.

        <p>
            At the same time, it would be helpful for my team if we had the most critical customer segment profiles mapped out. I wanted to start understanding the underlying JTBD and describe their workflows and potential challenges they might be facing. <span class="bold">We identified 4 different types of user groups:</span>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Property inspectors</li>
            <li>Appraisers</li>
            <li>Back-office employees</li>
            <li>Appraiser trainees</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We agreed with our client to <span class="bold">focus on property inspectors</span>, as they were the ones that are mainly interacting with the web and mobile applications. So, based on our discussions, I created a rough, high-level user journey that would describe the inspector's daily routine. Of course, we knew the workflow was incomplete and missing many details, but it was more than enough for us to continue. My goal was to keep building on top of it as we learned new things along the way.
        </p>

            In summary, property inspectors are responsible for measuring the property and collecting all the necessary photos and data. There is no need to have any particular background to perform the inspection. They use both the mobile (sketching) and web (review and error correction) application.

            Since we had the opportunity to redesign the whole experience from scratch, we needed to identify all significant usability issues that existed already, so we would avoid similar patterns in our future solution. After an agreement with our client, I suggested to my team to conduct a short <span class="bold">UX audit</span> to study the inspector's workflow in-depth and <span class="bold">understand at which step of the flow their problems might occur.</span> We happily dove into it. We each tried to create a floor plan for our apartment or part of our company's layout. The result was expected among us:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The sketch tools malfunctioned, mainly because of bugs, and didn't synergize together to ensure a pleasant experience. What seemed easy to do in the beginning ended up taking us a lot of time and effort.</li>
            <li>Switching between the sketch and form view could have been more intuitive. We needed help locating the exact input fields that had to be filled, as the form was too long and unstructured.</li>
        </ul>

Also, nothing is dynamically shown/hidden. Another pain point is that everything is in dropdown menus, and you can't multi-select."</span>
