        </header-section-wc>

        <p>
            When I'm thinking about interacting with public authorities, from requesting particular documents in order to complete an application form to a simple signature authenticity, I can‚Äôt help but feel overwhelmed by the lengthy procedures, waiting in lines, and broken communication channels.
        </p>

        <p>
            In September 2021, our client reached out to the software agency I was working with a vision to improve citizens' everyday communication <span class="bold"> with public authorities in Bahrain.</span> Communication between both parties had been a known challenge for many years, as it was almost entirely based on physical interaction, followed by bureaucratic procedures and clunky service experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            Onebox would be a completely new product that our team could start building from scratch, having lots of <span class="bold"> autonomy over product decisions</span>, design direction, and code architecture. This was a fantastic opportunity to join this project as it allowed me to spend the first couple of months on product discovery and research, something quite rare in an agency environment.
        </p>
        <p>
            At that time, I was also leading a team of 7 designers in my company. My knowledge around discovery became much more robust, which inspired me to share lots of new learnings with my team and re-imagine and improve <span class="bold"> our discovery/research approach on our future projects in our organization.</span>
        </p>
    </section-wc>

    <section-wc class="center-hrz bg-grey">

            <span slot="header-subtitle">product discovery</span>
            <span slot="header-title">Why are we building this product, and who are we building it for?</span>
        </header-section-wc>

        <p>
            My principle while approaching UX research was <span class="bold"> to focus on the problem space</span> as much as possible. I wanted conversations about deliverables to be redirected to the root cause, always investigating the underlying challenge or opportunity. As it was important to understand why we are building this product, who it is for,<span class="bold"> what challenges people in Bahrain are facing, and how they overcome those problems today</span>, I wrote a proposal suggesting to our clients how to kick off the discovery phase.
        </p>
        <p>
            I teamed up with my PM, and together, through a series of <span class="bold">stakeholder interviews and impact mapping workshops</span>, we were able to understand more about the goal of the project and its related actors. During that time, I learned that our goal should be to assist our client's team by identifying the <span class="bold">key opportunities</span> that would essentially turn into a coherent solution, enabling them to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Get government support and establish a strong partnership with public authorities and small/medium enterprises in Bahrain.</li>
            <li>Expand services beyond Bahrain and partner with Egypt Post, starting in Q3 of 2022.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Our client aimed to build a large ecosystem. Institutions such as banks, SMEs, telcos, etc., would mainly interact with a back-office, B2B product (later to be developed). <span class="bold">Onebox application targeted:</span>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>üë®‚Äç Bahrain citizens, aged 18-65</li>
            <li>üè≠ Small/medium enterprises</li>

        <p>
            When I learned there was <span class="bold">no direct competitor</span> in Bahrain, I wondered <span class="bold">how Onebox would gain a competitive advantage over other email clients</span>, like Gmail, as, at first sight, email clients could perfectly satisfy the JTBD mentioned above.
        </p>
        <p>
            For both public authorities and citizens/SMEs, there were opportunities to make a difference. I discovered that the product‚Äôs vision was mainly focused on security and delivering only important information, something other email clients don‚Äôt fully offer.

        </header-section-wc>

        <p>
            Based on research, I needed to come up with an approach that is more centered around what is essential for the user, keeping in mind how to bring value to Onebox partners as well:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Filter what's important for the user to read</li>
            <li>Inform users whether a message requires immediate action</li>
            <li>Let public authorities differentiate themselves by offering a more personalized experience (custom branding, a news feed, services, etc.)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            My team and I held multiple UX workshops to brainstorm about the app's navigation and basic information architecture. Among many, we selected the concept below and decided it would be the  <span class="bold">building block of the first round of prototyping.</span>
        </p>

        <image-container-wc class="container-sm image-container">

        <ul>
            <li>The concept behind the Home screen was that it would act as an action center. Users would be able to view all important messages that require an action to be performed (payment, signature, etc.) and the list of senders offering their services.</li>
            <li>The purpose of the Inbox screen was to archive all unimportant messages, like bank statements, data usage from the user's tariff, etc. Still, users could filter the messages by Bills, Contracts, and Statements, making it easier to orient.</li>
            <li>The partner detail screen would aggregate all messages received by that particular sender. Its primary purpose was to allow Batelco's partners to apply custom branding on their ‚Äúuniverse‚Äù and display all their available services.</li>
            <li>On the message detail, users would be able to read the message they have received, perform any required action by the sender and set a reminder.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Clearly, the concept above was simplified and was missing a lot of details and functionality, but it was sufficient to continue learning and building on top of it.
        </p>
        <p>
            I performed 6 rounds of usability testing, intending to <span class="bold">bring any navigation challenges to the surface</span> and other significant issues that would help our team shift focus and iterate.

            </figure-wc>
        </image-container-wc>

        <p>
            During the research, I learned that <span class="bold">citizens are expected to receive a maximum of 2-3 important messages per month.</span> The rest would be statements, receipts, or messages with informational content. <span class="bold">We defined important messages as the ones that require attention or immediate action</span> by the user.
        </p>

        <p>
            I started exploring many different concepts (some of them shown above). The first concept (categorized content) was moving in the right direction - it was focused on senders rather than displaying a raw list of messages. Eventually, we <span class="bold"> didn't go with this idea</span>, as there was <span class="bold">no way to inform users about the type of messages that required their attention.</span> The rest of the concepts were discarded as well. They were <span class="bold">too content-heavy</span>, and we aimed to simplify the home screen rather than overcomplicate it.
        </p>

        <p>
            In the end, I came up with an <span class="bold">idea that focused more on displaying content as an overview</span>, still keeping senders in the spotlight.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>The initial design of the bottom menu and the inbox were removed.</li>
            <li>The home screen acted as a crossroad to different ‚Äúuniverses‚Äù, and navigation had been flattened and simplified.</li>
            <li>The content felt more personalized and covered both the happy scenario and the pending state.</li>
            <li>Badges were replaced by smaller red dots. Users were expected to receive multiple unimportant messages per day, and we didn't want scary large numbers to feel overwhelming.</li>
        </ul>

            One of our <span class="bold">client's business goals was to establish a strong partnership with public authorities</span>, allowing them to distinguish themselves through <span class="bold">custom branding, provided services, and news feed.</span> I quickly dove into exploring various ideas on how to achieve the above.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some ideas were around making the partner universe feel more like a contact profile with shortcuts to different sections. The news feed was presented as a banner to draw attention, and quick actions (message, call, services) were shown at the top for direct interaction with the authority.
        </p>
        <p>
            After discussions with stakeholders, we felt the ‚Äúprofile‚Äù concepts would <span class="bold">deviate from</span> the original idea - reading important messages - so I didn't continue exploring that direction. We've also discussed that the concept of a news feed as a banner <span class="bold">would remind a lot of advertising</span>, which <span class="bold">conflicted with the app's value proposition (ad and spam-free content).</span> By the end of this exploration phase, we agreed to the following:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Focus on messages and introduce a menu at the bottom to switch to other views.</li>
            <li>Remove the repetitive avatar shown at the start of the message review and replace it with visuals that would indicate the type of messages, along with their current state (pending/resolved), in case an action was required.</li>
        </ul>

        </header-section-wc>

        <p>
            Structured data were important information for the user that a sender would manually (or sometimes automatically) insert into the sent message, like due dates, the total amount to be paid, etc.
        </p>

        <p>
            <span class="bold">The difficulty in visualizing those data was that it was unclear what possible use cases we would be facing.</span> Due to time limitations, our stakeholders couldn't provide us with a list of messages to get more context and understand things like the number of actions that will be shown to the user, the number of metadata that will be displayed, etc. So I organized a workshop with my PM, and together we brainstormed and tried to answer those questions based on our experience interacting with various authorities. We split them into 5 categories: Education, Health, Banks, Government offices, and Telcos.

        </image-container-wc>

        <p>
            In the end, the following steps were clear: I needed to design a solution flexible enough for any kind of content, as <span class="bold">structured data could be up to 5-6 and actions up to 2-3</span>. At that time, in the current implementation, <span class="bold">attachments were fixed at the bottom</span>. All the structured data and actions would take up lots of space, making it <span class="bold">impossible to read the message on smaller devices</span>. So I started experimenting with different layouts and interaction patterns until I came up with a solution closer to our goal.

            <li>I introduced a bottom sheet, which would have 3 states (default, collapsed and full screen).</li>
            <li>When opening the message detail screen, the drawer will be on its default state.</li>
            <li>On scroll (or by dragging the drawer down), the drawer will go on collapse state.</li>
            <li>By dragging the drawer all the way up, it would go to full screen state, where all information about the message will be shown</li>
            <li>By tapping on the ‚Äúx‚Äù icon (or by dragging all the way down), the drawer would go back to the default state.</li>

        <p>
            During the research phase, I learned that the majority of the GCC population consists of expats. However, the vision was still to distribute the app to countries where Arabic is the primary language. So when designing, it was important to think about optimizing the app for Arabic and the <span class="bold">UI's directionality to match the language's reading behavior</span>. After discussions with engineers, the directionality of the UI could be handled mainly by them. On the design front, there needed to be <span class="bold">extra focus on typography and icons</span>.

        <p>
            Before our first release, I performed another round of usability testing, talking to 5 participants in total for 30 minutes each. The goal was to understand the following:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Whether there are any issues in navigating within the app.</li>
            <li>Participants' ability to perform specific actions (paying a bill, setting a reminder)</li>
            <li>Participants' understanding of the screen after an important message has been resolved, but still having unread messages received by that sender.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Overall, there was a <span class="bold">positive outcome compared to the previous version:</span>
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>The home screen was more straightforward, and people understood it was a crossroad to messages grouped by sender.</li>
            <li>We resolved the navigation and IA issues we previously faced.</li>
            <li>Many of the features people identified (search, user avatar, services, call) were understood and found useful.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            After analyzing the results, I found <span class="bold">a few areas that could be improved:</span>

            <li>Discuss the reminder feature again, its value, and how a potential integration with GCalendar or native calendars would work.</li>
            <li>Rethink the red dots on the home screen and explore more options for the top banner.</li>

        <p>
            I'm very happy that after 6 months, and prior to any formal product release, <span class="bold">the design efforts stood out and made an impact on our customer's business goals as well as my team and company:</span>
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Batelco/Beyon Connect were excited about our output, and due to our commitment, they praised the design work and decided to hand over more projects to our team and agency.</li>
            <li>The initial design concepts and a preview of the future plans of the app allowed their sales and marketing teams to confidently present them to large audiences in Bahrain, which resulted in gaining additional partners and an agreement of future cooperation/app adoption with Egypt.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Throughout this journey and looking back, I'm so grateful to have been part of this wonderful team. I was given a chance to experience Shape Up methodology by Basecamp from scratch, be involved in PM responsibilities, have the time needed to provide well-defined design documentation, and lead a Design System team (more details on an upcoming case study).
